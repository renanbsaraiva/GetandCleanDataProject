GetandCleanDataProject
======================

This script creates a tidy data from the data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

Initially it reads the samsung files, merging the train files and the test files. Only the main variables are selected for the tidy data. An explanation of each variable is given in the codebook. The tidy data is created at the end of the script.
